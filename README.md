# The Mixing House

Created to learn a bit how Flask works as well as my first real project ever. This was alot of fun to make however this is now `DEPRECIATED` and no longer is being developed.


## Project technology

This project is running the following languages and tools:

* Python/Flask
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* SQLite3

## What I learned

For this project I actually learned a ton. This was my first real project I have ever tackled and I learned
alot about how Flask works. I also learned how validation for logins/registration works, and I believe made a
good system. I also learned how to manipulate a database for the first time.
